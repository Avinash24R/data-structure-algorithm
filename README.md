# DSA

Here is all the coding patterns you need to know, when to use them, what the benefit of the pattern is, a visual example, a code template to follow, and LeetCode questions you should solve to master the pattern.

## Overview

1. Sliding Window
2. Two pointers
3. Fast and Slow pointers
4. Graph

## Graph

Graph problems involve nodes and edges. They can be used to represent networks, relationships, and more. Understanding graph traversal algorithms and how to solve common graph problems is essential.

### Problems Solved

1. Directed Path (hasPath)
2. Undirected Path (undirectedPath)
3. Connected Components Count (connectedComponentsCount)
4. Largest Component (largestComponent)
5. Shortest Path (shortestPath)
6. Island Count (islandCount)

### Traversal Algorithms

1. Depth-First Traversal (DFS)
2. Breadth-First Traversal (BFS)
