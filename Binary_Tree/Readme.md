# Binary tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Binary trees are used in various applications such as searching, sorting, and representing hierarchical data.

### Requirements for Binary tree

1. At most 2 children per node
2. Exactly 1 root
3. Exactly 1 path between root and any node

### Common Operations

1. Insertion
2. Deletion
3. Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order)
4. Searching

### Traversal Algorithms

1. In-order Traversal
2. Pre-order Traversal
3. Post-order Traversal
4. Level-order Traversal

### Example Problems

1. **Depth First Values**: Return an array containing all values of the tree in depth-first order.
2. **Breadth First Values**: Return an array containing all values of the tree in breadth-first order.
3. **Tree Sum**: Return the total sum of all values in the tree.
4. **Tree Includes**: Return a boolean indicating whether or not a value is contained in the tree.
5. **Tree Minimum Value**: Return the minimum value within the tree.
6. **Maximum Path Sum**: Return the maximum sum of any root to leaf path within the tree.
